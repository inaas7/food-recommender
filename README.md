This program is created using Python and object-oriented programming. It recommends random recipes stored in a CSV file. 
The user can update the CSV file and put in their desired recipes. When the main.py file is run, the user is given three options. 
The program asks the user whether they want a random recommended recipe, recipes that contain a specific ingredient or ingredients, or recipes that can be made with only the input ingredients. 
It then displays the relevant recipes on the screen.
